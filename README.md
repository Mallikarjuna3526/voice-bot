🔗 **Live Demo:** https://mallikarjuna3526.github.io/Voice_bot_frontend/

This repository contains my **Stage-1 At-home Assessment** submission for the **100x Generative AI Engineer role**.

The project is a simple AI-powered chatbot / voicebot that responds **as me**, answering questions about my background, mindset, strengths, growth areas, and understanding of the role.
